Closed-Loop Control of BLDC/PMSM Motor

This repository contains code and models for implementing closed-loop control of Brushless DC (BLDC) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM). It supports sensorless and Hall sensor-based feedback methods using PI controllers.

ðŸ”§ Features
	â€¢	Closed-loop speed control
	â€¢	Supports BLDC and PMSM motors
	â€¢	Sensorless or sensored control (Hall effect)
	â€¢	Simulink/Matlab-based modeling and simulation
